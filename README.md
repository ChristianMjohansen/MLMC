# MLMC
This repository includes the MATLAB routines that were used in my Master's Thesis: "Multilevel Monte Carlo and numerical smoothing for options with non-smooth payoffs.
- The folder "section 3" includes scripts used in section 3, e.g. the estimation of MLMC option prices, and first order Greeks with analytical smoothing for the GBM dynamics.
- The folder "section 4" contains all scripts used in section 4, including the estimation of option prices, Greeks and densities for the GBM and Heston dynamics using MLMC with numerical smoothing.
- Each of these folders includes all the produced results.
